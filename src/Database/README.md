# Database

This folder contains everything related to the database itself. The
database is directly linked to the [PDO](http://php.net/manual/book.pdo.php)
class provided by PHP.

## How it works?

We use PDO for the database connection. The DAO will
hold the connection to the database.


## DBEntity

This class provides an entity storage.
